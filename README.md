## Tools used on the Challenge
- For the UI, I've only used React TS + CSS and avoid using UI Frameworks
- For the State Management, Only used useState / useEffect
- For the Routers, react-router with prop passing
- For fetching the data, I've created a custom hook to call the data.json provided
- TSLint/ESlint for strict coding
